        <h4>Why should you buy used phones on ORUphones?</h4>
        <p>1. Save more and buy from direct sellers: Did you know that 90% of the devices sold as refurbished phones on other websites do not undergo any refurbishment process? This means you are paying a hefty charge for a used phone that you could have bought for a nominal price directly from the seller. We help customers who are looking for a sweet deal in the used phone market by connecting you directly with genuine sellers so that you don't pay a heavy fee of commissions or the middleman charges. 
            <br /> 2. Verified sellers/devices: ORUphones provide an option to verify every seller/device before displaying them on a reselling platform. Unlike Quikr or OLX, we ensure that all the verified devices you buy are in working condition.
            <br /> 3. Best Deal: ORUphones uses an AI-based recommendation engine to find the best deal on a particular device model from thousands of deals.</p>
